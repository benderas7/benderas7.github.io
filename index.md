**Hi, I'm Andrew** - welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the [Neurosciences Graduate Program](https://neurograd.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, where I work with [Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/bradley-voytek.html) on brain mechanisms underlying cognitive functions like working memory.
