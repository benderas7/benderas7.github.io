**Hi, I'm Andrew** - welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the [Neurosciences Graduate Program](https://neurograd.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, where I work with [Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/bradley-voytek.html) on brain mechanisms underlying cognitive functions like working memory. 

You can learn more about me through my [beautifully crafted prose](/about/) or [boring CV](/cv/), [my research](/research/), or my [fun, extracurricular coding projects](/projects/).
