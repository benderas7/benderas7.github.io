**Hi, I'm Andrew** - welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the [Neurosciences Graduate Program](https://neurograd.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, where I work with [Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/bradley-voytek.html) on brain mechanisms underlying cognitive functions like working memory. I love [my research](), [my lab](https://voyteklab.com/), and the wonderfully monotonous weather that everyone else (who did not grow up in Minnesota) manages to still find ways to complain about.

Before starting my PhD in 2019, I spent four years at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I began my neuroscience research career in the [Multisensory Research Lab](https://vkc.vumc.org/multisensory/) during my time at Vanderbilt, working with [Dr. David Tovar](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mstp/person/david-a-tovar/) and [Dr. Mark Wallace](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/brain-institute/person/mark-t-wallace-ph-d/) to develop diagnostic tools for early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using multimodal brain imaging and deep learning. I miss Nashville Hot Chicken, Vandy's beautiful campus, and more affordable housing (although Nashville housing has also drastically increased in price since I left). 

I spend my free time playing board games, watching movies, and both watching and playing sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball, baseball, etc.). I am an increasingly big [Chelsea FC](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) fan, for better or for worse.
