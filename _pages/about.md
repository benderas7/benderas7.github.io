I work with the In Vivo Electrophysiology team at [Neurocrine Biosciences](https://www.neurocrine.com/). We evaluate how neurophysiological signals change with administration of drugs to develop translational biomarkers. I am automating the scoring of rodent neurophysiological data during sleep using Python, which will accelerate our team's analytical pipeline. Neurocrine is a wonderful place to work, and it has been fulfilling and refreshing to see dedicated, rigorous scientists apply their expertise from academia in a coordinated effort to bring treatments to patients.

I did my PhD in [Bradley Voytek's lab](https://voyteklab.com/) at UC San Diego. I loved my time in the Voytek Lab (Brad is a 10/10 mentor) and loved [the research](/research/) I did there. I also have grown to love the wonderfully monotonous weather that everyone else in San Diego (who did not grow up in Minnesota) manages to still find ways to complain about.

Before starting my PhD in 2019, I spent four years at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I began my neuroscience research career in the [Multisensory Research Lab](https://vkc.vumc.org/multisensory/) during my time at Vanderbilt, working with [Dr. David Tovar](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mstp/person/david-a-tovar/) and [Dr. Mark Wallace](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/brain-institute/person/mark-t-wallace-ph-d/) to develop diagnostic tools for early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using multimodal brain imaging and deep learning. I miss Nashville Hot Chicken, Vandy's beautiful campus, and more affordable housing (although Nashville housing has also drastically increased in price since I left).

I spend my free time playing board games, watching movies, and both watching and playing sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball, baseball, etc.). I am an increasingly big [Chelsea FC](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) fan, for better or for worse.
