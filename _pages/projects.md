# Extracurricular Projects
Programming is one of my favorite aspects of my work as a graduate student and computational neuroscientist. It is both a frustrating and exhilirating intellectual exercise that requires both problem solving and perserverance, making it all the more rewarding when you are able to turn something that was once an idea into a functional product that humans can use (even if it's just me). Below are two of the projects I have worked on in my spare time, in part to gain expertise in programming skills outside the purview of my graduate research, but mostly for fun.

## AzulRL

**Background**: Azul is a relatively simple yet entertaining board game (for any board game nerds unfamiliar with the game, Azul has a good 7.8 rating on [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul) with a low complexity score of 1.76/5). 2-4 players take turns drafting colorful tiles called *azulejos* (bottom left of picture on right) from *factory displays* (top left), which they place in their *pattern lines* (bottom right, with row of blue tiles). When a *pattern line* is complete, one *azulejo* is placed on the corresponding row of the player's *palace wall* (top right) and the player earns points. At the end of the game, the player with the most beautiful *palace wall* (i.e., the player with the most points) wins the game.

The game requires some strategy, but there is a beautiful alignment of aesthetics with scoring, so that (1) many people can do well just trying to make their *palace wall* pretty and (2) losing is still gratifying and fun. For these reasons, I believe it is a great board game for people like me who enjoy some strategy, and are working to enjoy board games even when they lose (and hopefully becoming less competitive and results-oriented than in the past).

**Approach**: After taking a wonderful class on Probabilistic Decision Making and Reasoning by [Dr. Lawrence Saul](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~lsaul/) and subsequently studying the preeminent [reinforcement learning (RL) textbook by Barto and Sutton](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Second-Paperback/dp/B0B95WFGV6/ref=asc_df_B0B95WFGV6/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=598233665925&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13818630893256662222&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031346&hvtargid=pla-1728961664549&psc=1&mcid=c9b20daf7e9c3665afef7e19130cf3cb&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6vaqBhCbARIsACF9M6kQJz3lqpXSghAIheJfkn8uTJ_il-D6raKh1Ko_DhH_79jY0q7pgE4aAmbeEALw_wcB), I have been working to train a RL agent to learn to play Azul using [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) to gain real-world experience with RL and hopefully one day have an Azul competitor whose schedule is always open. This is still a work in progress, so please check back soon to see what I've accomplished!
