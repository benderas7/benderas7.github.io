        <h2 id="developmental-changes-in-alpha-and-mu-rhythms">Developmental changes in alpha and mu rhythms</h2>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Update</strong>: We recently published this work on <em>bioRxiv</em> and it is under review at the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>!</p>

<p class="text-justify"><img src="/assets/images/alpha_mu_traces.png" width="400" class="align-right" />
<strong>Background</strong>: Alpha rhythms in occipital cortex and mu rhythms in sensorimotor cortex are two of the most prominent rhythms in the human brain (example rhythms and corresponding spatial topographies are shown to the right). They have similiar characteristic frequencies in the canonical alpha band (8–12 Hz) and serve important functions in gating modality-specific information. Both alpha-band rhythms have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in disorder-relevant tasks (e.g., social encoding tasks for ASD and attention-demanding tasks for ADHD). In this project, we investigated whether these rhythms could serve as biomarkers for these developmental disorders in resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Such biomarkers would greatly aid in developing effective early diagnostic tools for ASD and ADHD.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Methods</strong>: We used an <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html">openly available developmental dataset</a> of resting-state EEG recordings from nearly 3000 children (ages 5–18) from the <a href="https://childmind.org/">Child Mind Institute</a> published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017181">Alexander and colleagues (2017)</a>. We isolated high-fidelity alpha and mu rhythms from these recordings using an computationally efficient integration of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00744-x">spectral parameterization</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911000930">spatial filters</a>, and source localization. We then used burst detection and <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00273.2019">waveform shape analysis</a> to characterize the time series of these isolated alpha and mu rhythms:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/waveform_feats.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Results</strong>: First, we demonstrated that alpha rhythms are lower frequency, less asymmetrical, and higher amplitude than mu rhythms. These results quantifiably replicate qualitative differences in alpha and mu at an unprecendented scale:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/alpha_vs_mu_feats.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">Next, we discovered that alpha and mu rhythms are significantly different at age five and change differently across development:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/fig3_age.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">Finally, we showed that neither alpha nor mu rhythms are sensitive biomarkers in resting-state EEG, implying sensitive EEG biomarkers for ASD and ADHD may require deficit-specific task operalization:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/fig4_diagnosis.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We extended previous findings of alpha-band rhythms undergoing large changes in frequency during development, showing that these waveform shape measures also change substantially
across development. While none of these resting-state changes appear to be associated with common neurodevelopmental disorders, characterizing differences across rhythm types remains
vital for constraining generative models for alpha-band rhythms.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-spatial-location-from-aperiodic-and-alpha-oscillatory-activity">Decoding spatial location from aperiodic and alpha oscillatory activity</h2>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Background</strong>: Working memory (WM) refers to one’s ability to hold and manipulate a limited amount of information in mind for a short period of time, usually on the order of seconds, and is integral to many other cognitive functions. Previous work from <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00860.2015">Foster and colleagues (2016)</a> demonstrated that the topopgraphy of alpha-band activity (8–12 Hz) tracks the spatial location in stimuli in WM, suggesting that alpha oscillations coordinate the cellular assemblies that code the content of WM. Previous work in our lab by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00744-x">Donoghue, Haller, Peterson, et al., (2020)</a> has shown that standard spectral analyses can conflate oscillatory changes with change in aperiodic activity. In this project, we sought to distiniguish the roles of alpha oscillatory and aperiodic activity in WM using sliding-window <a href="https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/">spectral parameterization</a> to ensure the development of an accurate physiological understanding of visual WM and the true role of alpha oscillations therein.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Methods</strong>: In collaboration with <a href="https://awhvogellab.com/">Drs. Ed Awh and Ed Vogel</a>, we used EEG data from participants at the University of Oregon (<em>n</em> = 56) and the University of Chicago (<em>n</em> = 56) that came from three published, publically available datasets (<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00860.2015">Foster et al., (2016)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221731196X">Foster et al., (2017)</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000239">Sutterer et al., (2019)</a>). Even though the EEG data come from seven different tasks, all data were collected while participants attended and remembered features of stimuli presented around fixation across a delay, requiring WM. All tasks were continuous report, where participants were required to report the location, color, or orientation of the target stimulus, except for task 3, where participants only had to indicate whether there was a change in the probe stimulus from the target stimulus:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/wm_tasks.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>We computed spectrograms for each sensor and determined the aperiodic exponent and alpha oscillatory power for each time point using <a href="https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/">spectral parameterization</a>. Following the procedure of the <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00860.2015">Foster and colleagues (2016)</a>, we then fit an inverted encoding model (IEM) to assess how strongly spatial location was represented by the aperiodic exponent and alpha oscillatory power throughout the trial.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Results</strong>: We first reproduced the authors’ findings that total alpha power encodes spatial location during WM. The channel tuning function (CTF) slope, which represents how strongly the population activity in the alpha band encodes the spatial location of the stimulus, increases soon after stimulus presentation and remains high throughout the delay period (red line for each task below):</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/IEMs_tasks1-7.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">Encoding of spatial location by alpha oscillatory power was high throughout the delay period (blue line for each task above) in each of the seven tasks, supporting the idea that alpha oscillations act as a scaffolding signal that coordinate which of the underlying retinotopic cellular assemblies maintain the stimulus features in working memory. This encoding of spatial location by alpha oscillatory power was significantly greater across the delay period than when location labels were shuffled:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/pw_ctf_slope_paired_ttest.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">By contrast, encoding of spatial locaiton by the aperiodic exponent peaks during the early portion of the stimulus presentation for all seven tasks (green line for each task above). Moreover, this early peak in aperiodic activity encoding of spatial location occurs soon after stimulus onset regardless of the total stimulus presentation time, suggesting that aperiodic activity encodes spatial location quickly and automatically once the stimulus has been presented. This encoding is consistent with previous work in our lab by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917305621?via%3Dihub">Gao et al., (2017)</a> that showed that the aperiodic exponent reflects the relative balance of excitation and inhibition in the underlying neural populations, such that a surge of excitation in the underlying neural populations necessary to encode the stimulus features during stimulus presentation is reflected in detectable changes in the EEG aperiodic exponent. The encoding of spatial location by the aperiodic exponent was significantly greater in the first 400 ms following stimulus presentation than when location labels were shuffled:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/exp_ctf_slope_paired_ttest.png" width="700" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We confirmed previous findings that the topography of alpha oscillatory activity encodes spatial location in working memory, deconfounding these effects from changes in aperiodic activity. Furthermore, we discovered that the aperiodic exponent encodes spatial location during the first 400 ms after stimulus presentation. Together, these findings highlight the utility of sliding-window spectral parameterization to decouple and characterize two, time-varying, physiologically distinct neural mechanisms for encoding and working memory.</p>
